The goal of `bis620.2023` is to provide a user-friendly interface that
allows the viewer to explore a large database of clinical studies.
Inside lies an R Shiny app that serves as an interactive dashboard,
allowing the user to query trials based on their keyword(s) of interest
and subsequently shows relevant data visualizations and tables
pertaining to the results, such as what phases the studies were in, what
countries were involved, and what conditions were examined.

A final write-up that analyzes CDC/ATSDR Social Vulnerability Index data
and wildfire risk data is included as a vignette and linked in the next
section.
